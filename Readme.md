## Results

- created [IAST agent](https://github.com/light-hat/immunity-python-agent);
- created management server (this repo);
- collected [training dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/l1ghth4t/iast-python3-django-flask);
- performed [transfer learning of BERT model](https://huggingface.co/l1ghth4t/immunity) for the task of vulnerability detection;
- developed [test bench](https://github.com/light-hat/devsecops-stand) describing the system implementation in DevSecOps processes.

## Concept

What IAST is and how it works is described [separately](Theory.md).

What the analysis is based on:

- request processing context (bundle: `request + control flow + response`) for CWEs (9 vulnerabilities) using ML;
- dependency analysis (`versions of used libraries`) for CVE, PYSEC, etc. using open databases;
- configuration analysis (a separate plugin for processing `project settings`).

General scheme of work of the project:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
loop Runtime
User->>Instrumented app: HTTP-request
Instrumented app->>Management server: Runtime data (context)
Instrumented app-->>User: HTTP-response
end
Management server->>ML-model: Tokenized context data
ML-model-->>Management server: Vulnerability label
User->>Management server: Requesting a list of vulnerabilities
Management server-->>User: List of found vulnerabilities
```

## Hardware requirements

> [!NOTE]
> The server with the specified characteristics was used for system development and testing.

| Parameter | Value                   |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| OS        | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit |
| CPU       | 4 cores                 |

| GPU       | 1 √ó Tesla T4  16 GB     |

## Preflight

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install `Docker` and `Docker Compose` on the server using this [instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) from the official Docker website.

When Docker is installed, check your GPU drivers:

```shell
nvidia-smi
```

  <summary>üëÄ How to install GPU drivers</summary>

<hr />

Install driver compilation tools and kernel headers:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Look for available versions of the driver:

```shell
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

Find a similar line in the output:

```text
...
driver   : nvidia-driver-535 - distro non-free recommended
...
```

This is the version of the driver you need to install:

```shell
sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-535
```

Then restart the server:

```shell
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, check the GPU drivers again:

```shell
nvidia-smi
```

<hr />

</details>

After that, check to see if `NVIDIA Container Toolkit` is installed on the server:

```shell
dpkg -l | grep nvidia-container-toolkit
```

> [!TIP]
> If this answer is blank, here is the [manual](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) from the official website on how to install `NVIDIA Container Toolkit`.

> [!WARNING]
> After installing `NVIDIA Container Toolkit`, remember to restart `Docker`. The command is given below.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Start

1. Clone repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/light-hat/immunity-iast
cd immunity-iast
```

2. Run this command to create the configuration::

```shell
make config
```

<details>

  <summary>üëÄ Environment variables in the configuration</summary>

<hr />

- `API_URL`: the address where the service will be deployed;

- `API_PORT`: the port on which the service will receive requests;

- `POSTGRES_HOST`: the database host (the name of the service in the application stack);

- `POSTGRES_PORT`: the port of the database;

- `POSTGRES_USER`: database user;

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: database password;

- `POSTGRES_DB`: name of the database used by the service;

<hr />

</details>

3. Start the application stack:

```shell
make up
```

4. Check the logs
